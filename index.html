            <h5>Why I created this script?</h5>

            <h6>• Disclaimer</h6>
            <p>This script may not work for everyone. It's designed to work with a common style. Also No data is sent
                anywhere—everything runs in your browser. Heads up; you need to load the individual project JSON files,
                not the backup_config.json file. You can check out the project on <a
                    href="https://github.com/romiojoseph/version-control-backup-log-viewer" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">GitHub</a>.
                I developed the entire JavaScript using LLMs (Mistal AI and Claude). Also, hey it's a PWA! So just
                install and pin it if you use the backup script more often.</p>

            <h6>• Backstory</h6>
            <p>
                I got into coding <a
                    href="https://romio.substack.com/p/ai-assisted-learning-journey-10000-hours-snowball-effect"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recently</a>, mostly because LLMs started giving more
                accurate results. I began with small
                scripts, and since then, I've created many things. With every new project, I'm testing my own limits.
                That's one of the main reasons I don't use trackers or analytics. I want people to browse these projects
                knowing their sessions are not tracked or measured. But since I deploy everything on GitHub Pages, their
                trackers might exist, I'm not sure about that.
            </p>

            <h6>• Why</h6>
            <p> These days, it's easy to build small-scale projects with LLMs, and the gaps are closing fast. I admit I
                don't fully understand how JavaScript or Python works. But when I explain what I need and test things, I
                know what to expect and how to guide the LLM to get the results I want.
            </p>
            <p> I'm not sure if I'm getting better at coding, but I'm getting better at explaining my requirements. What
                we need is patience because this isn't a one-way route or a straightforward process. We need to go
                back and forth many times, and sometimes we may hit a wall and question our own abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when we finally get results, it's a moment of pure joy and satisfaction. That's what keeps me going.
                In this journey, LLMs hallucinate, because whatever their context length is, they just remove features
                and functionalities and our code might break. And that will drive our entire day or sometimes days. Some
                bugs won't even let us sleep. Because we know, our project works, but some error keeps repeating. That
                happened to me many times in the beginning. Eventually, I started taking zips of the project folder
                whenever I copy-pasted new changes, just to create a safe restore point. So that I can start again from
                a position I'm comfortable with.
            </p>
            <p>I tried Git, but it felt too complicated, and since I was just starting, I avoided overwhelming
                experiences. I didn't mind creating zips manually. However, one day I started to dislike this proces. It
                felt like a lot. I knew a script could simplify it, but I never made it a priority. At some point, I hit
                my limit and created <a
                    href="https://github.com/romiojoseph/open-source/tree/main/utility-scripts/version-control-backup-python-script"
                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the first version of this script</a>. It was very handy,
                until it wasn't.
            </p>

            <h6>• Optimize</h6>
            <p>To optimize anything, we have to use it daily. Only then we can spot potential issues. My script's first
                version was straightforward, but I felt something was missing and started thinking it wasn't quite there
                yet. While building the <a href="https://github.com/romiojoseph/lichess-pgn-analyzer" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">Lichess PGN Analyzer</a> project, I started considering a lightweight
                Electron
                app.
            </p>
            <p>But when I tried one, I felt it was too much and defeated the purpose. So, I thought of other ways to
                make the process simpler. I wanted fewer clicks and real-time updates, but some browser limitations
                prevent files from auto-reloading. I had to manually initiate that process, but it was a step I was
                willing to take. After exploring possibilities, I concluded that a PWA is the best option for now.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe there are already solutions for this pain point I'm trying to solve, but I like creating a workflow
                that works for me. Not everything can be customized to meet unique needs. That's why I share all my
                projects on GitHub. So people exploring solutions for their needs can clone the project and tweak it as
                they like. (Please note that the default content in the table is just a placeholder.)
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s a good practice to write clear and meaningful backup messages to help you easily understand the
                context of each version. The `logs` folder will be created in the same directory as the Batch and Python
                scripts. Deleted logs are retained for safety and clarity. Ensure the script path stays synchronized
                with a secure cloud storage service using <a href="https://syncthing.net" target="_blank"
                    rel="nofollow noopener">Syncthing</a> or
                any alternative of
                your choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the script includes safeguards to prevent data loss, it is always a good practice to manually
                verify backups every now and then and ensure that important data is not accidentally deleted or
                overwritten. If you have any concerns, review the code using any LLMs thoroughly to understand what
                it does. Ensure that it aligns with your expectations and does not perform any unwanted actions.
                Before running the script on critical data, test it in a safe environment with non-essential data to
                ensure it behaves as expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this script was created with the help of LLMs, I used another LLM to review its safety. The
                following was its conclusion:

                "The script appears to be designed with safety in mind, but it is always important to review and test
                any script before running it on critical data. Ensure you understand what the script does and trust the
                source of the code."
            </p>
